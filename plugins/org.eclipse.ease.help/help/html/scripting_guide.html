	<h2>Eclipse Advanced Scripting Environment (EASE)</h2>

	<p>EASE provides scripting support, allowing to interact with the IDE using scripts in various languages.</p>
	<p>Scripts do have access to their native language features, eg python scripts do have access to all available python libraries.
	Further scripts do have access to the Java runtime, allowing to access and manipulate Java objects.
	Therefore scripts operate on the same level as normal Eclipse plug-ins.</p>
	
	<p>Currently following script engines are supported:
	<ul>
		<li>JavaScript (Rhino)</li>
		<li>JavaScript (Nashorn)</li>
		<li>Jython</li>
		<li>Python via Py4J</li>
		<li>Ruby</li>
		<li>Groovy</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
