	<h1>Scripting Integration in Eclipse</h1>

	<h2>Script Engines</h2>

	<p>EASE script engines integrate
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Choose <strong>Run &gt;Run As &gt;EASE Script</strong> from
			the context menu of a file in the workspace.
		</li>
		<li>Choose <strong>Run &gt;Run As &gt;EASE Script</strong> from
			the context menu of an open editor containg script code.
		</li>
		<li>Select <a class="command-link"
			href="javascript:executeCommand(&quot;org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenRunConfigurations&quot;)"
			shape="rect"> <img
				alt="Opens the Run Launch Configurations dialog"
				src="/help/topic/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" /> <strong>Run
					&gt; Run Configurations...</strong></a> or <a class="command-link"
			href="javascript:executeCommand(&quot;org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenDebugConfigurations&quot;)"
			shape="rect"> <img
				alt="Opens the Debug Launch Configurations dialog"
				src="/help/topic/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" /> <strong>Run
					&gt; Debug Configurations...</strong></a> from the workbench menu bar.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The first 2 methods will automatically create a launch
		configuration and execute the script right away. In some cases, you
		will want to adjust the launch parameters or specify additional
		arguments. Therefore you have to choose the third option.</p>



	<h3>How to create a launch configuration:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Select <a class="command-link"
			href="javascript:executeCommand(&quot;org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenRunConfigurations&quot;)"
			shape="rect"> <img
				alt="Opens the Run Launch Configurations dialog"
				src="/help/topic/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" /> <strong>Run
					&gt; Run Configurations...</strong></a> or <a class="command-link"
			href="javascript:executeCommand(&quot;org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenDebugConfigurations&quot;)"
			shape="rect"> <img
				alt="Opens the Debug Launch Configurations dialog"
				src="/help/topic/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" /> <strong>Run
					&gt; Debug Configurations...</strong></a> from the workbench menu bar.
		</li>
		<li>This opens a dialog that lets you create, modify, and delete
			launch configurations of different types.</li>
		<li>Select <strong>EASE Script</strong> in the left hand list of
			launch configuration types, and press the <strong>New</strong> button
			in the toolbar. This will create a new launch configuration for a
			script. The tabs on the right hand side allow you control specific
			aspects of the launch.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Global</strong> tab defines the file to be
				launched. Either select a workbench file or a system resource here.
				After the file is selected you may change the <i>script engine</i>
				to be used. <br /> <i>Script arguments</i> are passed to
				the script directly as String[] named argv. Enter multiple arguments
				by separating them with spaces.<br /> <br /> The debug options
				allow to define which parts of the code get displayed and when to
				stop execution by default.<br /> <i>Show dynamic script
					content</i> allows to step into dynamically generated script code such
				as module loading.<br /> <i>Suspend on startup</i> stops
				execution in the first line of code.<br /> <i>Susped on
					script load</i> additionally stops execution whenever a new source file
				gets executed (such as includes and dynamic code).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For other tabs see <a
				href="/help/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/tasks-java-local-configuration.htm">Java
				Launch Configuration</a>.

	<h2>Executing within the Script Shell</h2>

	<p>The script shell view allows to execute script file by using the
		include command. You may either type it in or directly drag and drop
		the file into the shell. As scripts are included, they are not spawned
		as a separate thread and run in the context of th script shell view.
		Therefore they have full access to the current variable stack. They
		also will block the shell until execution is terminated.</p>

	<h2>Executing scripts from Script Explorer</h2>

	<p>Scripts fetched from script locations are visible within the
		Script Explorer view. There they can be executed by a double click and
		spawn as a separate thread, similar to an <strong>EASE Script</strong> launch configurations</p>
