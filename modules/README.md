EASE Modules
============

This is the modules part of Eclipse's EASE project. It contains script modules that reference and utilize other eclipse components. In case EASE gets part of the platform once, these modules should be migrated to their target projects.

For more information and important links, refer to the [EASE documentation page] [1] or the [EASE project overview page] [2].
